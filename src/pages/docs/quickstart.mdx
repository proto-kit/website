# Quickstart

The fastest way to start building with Protokit is to use the [starter kit](https://github.com/proto-kit/starter-kit).
The starter kit provides a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo1) aimed at kickstarting application chain development using the Protokit framework.

<Steps>
### Install dependencies

Before you can start building with Protokit, you need to install the following dependencies:

- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

    Are you using Windows? Please use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run the commands below.
</Callout>

### Clone the starter kit

```bash
# Clone the starter kit
git clone https://github.com/proto-kit/starter-kit my-chain
cd my-chain

# Ensure you're on the right nodejs version and install dependnecies
nvm use
pnpm install
```

### Run the tests

```bash
# run and watch tests for the `chain` package
pnpm run test --filter=chain
```

> There's an optional `--watchAll` flag, which will re-run the test suite when files change.
>
> Depending on your shell, you may need to prefix any extra flags with an additional `--` 
> like so: `pnpm run test --filter=chain -- --watchAll`. This is applicable across all the commands in this guide.


### Run the sequencer & the UI

```bash
# build dependency chain package
pnpm run build --filter chain

# starts sequencer only
pnpm env:inmemory dev --filter chain

# starts UI only
pnpm env:inmemory dev --filter web
```

### Open the demo UI in the browser

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the results. Assuming your setup went well,
you'll see an example UI that allows you to interact with your app-chain.

Alternatively you can try [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql) to interact with the GraphQL API explorer directly.

### Interact with the demo UI

Setup the [Auro wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/) if you haven't already. Then connect your wallet in the UI, and claim some tokens from the faucet.

__Congratulations, you've just ran your first app-chain built using Protokit! 🎉__

### Protokit environments, persistence and sequencer deployment

To learn more about Protokit environments and how to host your app-chain, check out the [starter-kit readme](https://github.com/proto-kit/starter-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#running)**.**
</Steps>

## Folder structure

After completing the quickstart setup, you'll end up with a basic Protokit project.
The project itself is a monorepo containing a Next.js/React based web app at `apps/web`, that connects to an example application chain from `packages/chain`.

The folder structure looks something like this:

<FileTree>

  <FileTree.Folder name="apps/web" open={true}>
    <FileTree.Folder name="containers" open={true}>
      <FileTree.File name="async-layout.tsx"/>
      <FileTree.File name="async-page.tsx"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>

     <FileTree.Folder name="lib/stores" open={true}>
      <FileTree.File name="balances.tsx"/>
      <FileTree.File name="chain.tsx"/>
      <FileTree.File name="client.tsx"/>
      <FileTree.File name="wallet.tsx"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>

  <FileTree.Folder name="packages/chain" open={true}>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" open={true}>
      <FileTree.File name="balances.ts"/>
      <FileTree.File name="runtime.ts"/>
      <FileTree.File name="chain.config.ts"/>
      <FileTree.File name="client.config.ts"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="test" open={true}>
      <FileTree.File name="balances.test.ts"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>

</FileTree>
