# Provable Events
The ability for a runtime method to emit provable events gives the user a way to produce events that are verifiable. Use-cases for this include
the indexer and processor, and explorers. The events appear in the output of the runtime method and are stored in the database.
Note that due to the variable-like nature of the number of events emitted, we commit to a hash of the events.

Consider the below example for how to define a runtime module and method which outputs provable events.
```typescript {28-31,36-39} showLineNumbers"
export class TestEvent extends Struct({
  message: Bool,
}) {}

@runtimeModule()
class EventMaker extends RuntimeModule {
  public constructor() {
    super();
  }

  public events = new RuntimeEvents({
    primary: TestEvent,
  });

  @runtimeMethod()
  public async makeEvent() {
    this.events.emit("primary", new TestEvent({ message: Bool(false) }));
  }
}
```
