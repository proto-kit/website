# Worker Architecture

The way protokit is architected, in regards to computation-heavy tasks, we have the following three-party setup:
- Sequencer - this is the master "node" that does the sequencing, tracing and pushes proving tasks. In reality, this can be a multi-process deployment, but we can simplify this to a single actor here.
- Workers - One or more stateless actors that have a set of tasks that they can compute. Tasks in our case are mostly proving-related work.
- Message Queue - Distributes tasks from the sequencer to the workers and reports back the results

If `worker` modules are defined in the AppChain it becomes a `worker`. This has the same architecture as a regular AppChain,
but it can process expensive asynchronous `tasks`, such as Block Proving. An AppChain can be defined such that only `worker` modules are present, which means
its only function is to execute tasks, rather than serve as a sequencer. For testing purposes, it is fine to have the main AppChain be the worker, but in
production set-ups you will likely want multiple stand-alone workers defined, separately.

## LocalTaskWorkerModule

This module is used to create a worker locally. Without this being defined in some process no worker will be spawned and
this means no tasks will be processed. This module is itself defined with several tasks that it will be capable of executing, such as
 - StateTransitionTask,
 - StateTransitionReductionTask,
 - RuntimeProvingTask,
 - BlockProvingTask,
 - BlockReductionTask,
 - BlockBuildingTask,
 - NewBlockTask,
 - CircuitCompilerTask
 - WorkerRegistrationTask.

When the `LocalTaskWorkerModule` is started it has a subset of start-up tasks, like those above, passed to it.
These tasks basically define what sort of computations the worker can handle, as you may want different workers to handle different tasks for resourcing reasons.
For example, the majority of the work the AppChain will do is for State Transition related tasks, and so you may want to configure a large share of the workers to handle only the StateTransitionTask
and StateTransitionReductionTask, which allows easier scalability as only one circuit will be kept in memory. There are two types of tasks: `Unprepared`, i.e. tasks that don’t have a prepare method and therefore don’t need to wait for registration to get initialized, and
 `Regular`, i.e. all other tasks that require registration.

When the worker is started it first registers the required callback functions for the `Unprepared` tasks, i.e. `CircuitCompilerTask` and `WorkerRegistrationTask`,
with its local instance of the queue. Then, the `LocalTaskWorkerModule` calls the `prepare` method for non-startup/normal tasks, before registering their callbacks with the queue.
This registration ensures the worker is ready to handle any request when one later arrives via the queue. Once all the tasks are registered a promise is resolved, called `prepareResolve`.
This tells the `LocalTaskWorkerModule` it is ready, and the `LocalTaskWorkerModule` emits a `ready` event of its own that other modules like the `WorkerReadyModule` are waiting for to proceed.

## WorkerReadyModule

This is another sequencer module that waits until key events have been emitted by the `LocalTaskWorkerModule` to signal that the worker
is ready and that the AppChain can continue. The `WorkerReadyModule` is called by the `AppChain.ts` at the end of the `start()` method.
If the `waitForReady()` method on the `WorkerReadyModule` is never resolved then the AppChain will never finish its start-up. Note that the
`waitForReady()` will always complete if the AppChain is not a worker, in particular if `LocalTaskWorkerModule` is not defined.

## SequencerStartUpModule

This module is designed to ensure that all zk-circuits are compiled and their verification keys are accessible to the workers that
will need them. This spares workers from having to waste resources compiling the circuits themselves. This is achieved by having the AppChain
use the verification keys, which are static parameters, as input to the `WorkerRegistrationFlow`. This in turns leaves
it as a task on the queue. A worker when starting-up will process the task that has been pushed onto the queue and access these static parameters
that way. In order for subsequent workers to have access to the same task, which will be removed from the queue after having been executed, the
sequencer uses the `WorkerRegistrationFlow` to push the same task again in a boundless loop. This loop consumes no resources as it is just a `Promise` that
awaits until a worker has registered. We ensure it's the new worker that picks up this task from the queue and not an older worker that is already configured,
by having the old worker be configured to delete the task-handler for the registration from its local queue so that it can't handle that particular kind of task, anymore.

## Worker Start-up Flow

A summary of the worker registration flow. The sequencer is started and then:
1. The worker registers the callbacks for `Unprepared` tasks (i.e. those tasks that do not require the worker to be registered first) with the queue, one of which is the
`WorkerRegistration` task and the other is `CircuitCompilerTask`.
2. The AppChain, specifically `SequencerStartupModule`, emits the `CircuitCompilerTask` to compile certain zk-circuits of the various zk-Programs.
3. The worker listens to the queue, processes the `CircuitCompilerTask` task.
4. The `SequencerStartupModule` invokes  the `WorkerRegistrationFlow`, which submits a `WorkerRegistration` task in a boundless
loop to the queue. Within this task, the verification keys for the circuits are included.
5. The worker listens to the queue, processes the `WorkerRegistration` task and is initialised.
6. The worker calls the `prepare()` method for the `Regular` tasks.
7. The worker registers `Regular` tasks with the queue.
8. The worker is now able to process all configured tasks emitted to the queue.
9. The AppChain continues and starts submitting tasks, like BlockProving and StateTransition, say, to the queue.


## TaskQueue

The TaskQueue has two different implementations:

### BullQueue

This is Redis underneath. Each worker registers to consume specific jobs. Redis takes care of a lot of the implementation details.
This uses a separate Redis instance, whose configuration details are shared with the AppChain  on start-up.
In the starter-kit, this is run from Docker.

### LocalTaskQueue

This can only be used by one worker built into the AppChain, as it's not really a queue, executing tasks directly where possible.
The `workNextTasks()` is called whenever a task is added to the queue and again after tasks have already been executed (in case any others have been added in the meanwhile).
The `LocalTaskQueue` isn't suitable for production usage because it runs only one instance in-process. But for mock-proofs it's good enough.
